# Oregon Trail Flask

This is a template for integrating students' Oregon Trail assignments with an HTML/CSS/JS frontend and a Repl/Flask frontend. You may set up a Repl project, move over the files `static/*`, `templates/*`, `main.py`, and `assignment.py`, then run! As long as `assignment.py` is implemented according to the specification provided in the PDF file, you should have a nice interactive frontend for your intro Python assignment!

This template also includes student-facing instructions in the `docs/` directory.
